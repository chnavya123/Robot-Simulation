Project name: RobotSimulation

Project description:
RobotSimulation is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly interface to control a robot. The project involves creating a robot, designing a user interface with divided screens, and implementing control settings for the robot.

Project Planning:
Modules:
Module 1: Making a robot
Module 2: Designing divided screen with robot and settings
Module 3: Implementing control settings for the robot
Module 4: Implementing basic movements (walking, sitting, standing)
Module 5: Adding directional movement controls
Module 6: Incorporating avatar customization
Module 7: Expressing emotions and gestures

Module 1: Making a robot
Steps:
1.1. Research and select components for the robot
1.2. Assemble the physical components according to the design specifications
1.3. Program basic functionalities such as movement and sensor interactions

Module 2: Designing divided screen with robot and settings
Steps:
2.1. Plan the layout of the user interface
2.2. Develop the graphical elements for the interface
2.3. Implement functionality to divide the screen into two parts
2.4. Integrate the robot display into one part of the screen
2.5. Create settings interface for the other part of the screen

Module 3: Implementing control settings for the robot
Steps:
3.1. Identify key control parameters for the robot (speed, direction, etc.)
3.2. Develop user-friendly controls for adjusting these parameters
3.3. Implement communication between the settings interface and the robot
3.4. Test the control settings to ensure proper functionality

Module 4: Implementing basic movements (walking, sitting, standing)
Steps:
4.1. Program animations for walking, sitting, and standing actions
4.2. Integrate the animations into the simulation environment
4.3. Develop controls to trigger these movements within the simulation

Module 5: Adding directional movement controls
Steps:
5.1. Design a control scheme for directional movement (forward, backward, left, right)
5.2. Implement algorithms for translating directional inputs into simulated movements
5.3. Test and refine the movement controls to ensure smooth operation

Module 6: Incorporating avatar customization
Steps:
6.1. Create a variety of avatar models with different appearances
6.2. Develop controls for users to select and customize the avatar
6.3. Integrate avatar customization options into the simulation interface

Module 7: Expressing emotions and gestures
Steps:
7.1. Define a range of emotions and gestures for the robot (e.g., happy, sad, waving)
7.2. Create animations and facial expressions to convey these emotions and gestures
7.3. Integrate emotion and gesture controls into the simulation interface
